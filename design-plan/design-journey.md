# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is a club called Media & Entertainment at Cornell(CME). Their events blend media and entertainment seamlessly, capturing imaginations and invoking the senses. Whether it's the eerie allure of Halloween Party, the rhythmic beats of Cornell Rapping Competition, Heart Signal's romantic vibes, or the Food Station's culinary adventures, every gathering is an emblematic celebration of artistry and talent.
But at their core, CME is dedicated to a mission - to promote and elevate Asian culture on campus. Through their events, partnerships, and initiatives, CME aims to amplify the rich tapestry of traditions, stories, and experiences that Asian culture brings, fostering understanding and appreciation within the broader Cornell community.

Our client CME wants a static website that posts all their past events and highlights, and the content is fixed by the information they provide to us. The club wants to attract more sponsors to invest, and more students to join the club. Therefore, they aim to have approximately four pages for their website, including the homepage, past events, club members, and application. By allowing Cornell students to view the website on different devices, they hope to make it easy for them to browse at any time on laptop,tablets and mobile devices. It's easy for our group to test and refine the website since Cornell students are one of the most important target audiences.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.
Cornell Media and Entertainment holds different social events that give back to its students, including Annual Halloween Night, Cornell Rapping Competition, Heart Signal and CME Food Station.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?
We invite international guest performers to perform at Cornell, giving students opportunities for a free show. Meanwhile, we want to promote Asian and Chinese culture on campus, such as providing traditional Chinese handmade food.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?
Because we currently don’t have one, and we want to attract more sponsors to get to know our club, as well as more students to join us. Not a lot of people on campus know this club, and we want to increase our presence.


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?
Potential sponsors, and Cornell students who are interested in participating in the events or joining the club.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?
Click on different pages of our events & members, having a better understanding of our club, and then contact us if they are interested in sponsoring or joining the club.


6. What are your goals for this site?
Establish more partnerships and attract more people to join our club.


7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?
We want people to feel that we are a bunch of cool people together, and have innovative event ideas. We also want the site to impress people by having a strong visual impact. The site doesn’t have to look formal, it can be more of a fun vibe.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?
Cornell Breakfree, their background color is black and makes the rest of the contents outstanding. The visual contrast makes me focus on the members, and the repetition of group photos shows me that their team means a lot to this club, which makes me want to be part of it.
Cornell IGEM. Their website is organized, and they do really well in creating sections, interacting with their audience. The formatting is not redundant.
Parsons Underfashion Club. As I clicked on the website, the logo was impressive and outstanding, which goes along with the vibe of the club. The website clearly organized different sections, by using a left-right layout on main page. People can quickly access the information they need by clicking on the navigation bar, which expands to detailed information. As a result, I felt that the color scheme was creative and aesthetic.

9. How many pages do you want in your website? What is the most crucial information you want to include?
Approximately 4 pages, including event highlight, club members, homepage and contact page for sponsors to contact us.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

Our client, CME, is in need of a website that showcases their historical events and notable achievements. The club's primary objectives are to draw in additional sponsors for financial support and to encourage greater student participation in their activities. To achieve these goals, they intend to create a website comprising approximately four pages, which will include a homepage, a section for past events, information about club members, and an application page. Their vision is to ensure that Cornell students can easily access and navigate the website from various devices such as laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, allowing for convenient browsing at any time.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal 1: Attract new members and grow club membership
- Goal 2: Garner awareness of CME, increasing the organization’s campus presence
- Goal 3: Attract potential club sponsors and partnerships, enabling CME to increase the scope and reach of its events
- Goal 4: Communicate CME’s values through a fun design representative of the organization’s mission and goals

### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

Our website will be consisted of four content-full pages. It corresponds to the rule-of-thumb so that each member of the team will get 1 page to work on. Our initial draft of the website is a homepage, a past events page, a club members page, and an application page. Thus, we believe it’s a necessary size that isn't too small and isn't too big.

  - Photo gallery of past events
  - A three-column layout that displays recent events

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.


The site’s audience is Cornell students who are interested in media and entertainment. This is a cohesive group because CME is a Cornell club for students who are interested in tapping into their creative side, and find a like-minded community to share their creativity.

**Audience Revision**
The site’s audience is Cornell students who are interested in Asian culture, media & entertainment, and are interested learning more about CME and potentially joining the club. This is a cohesive group because CME is a Cornell club for students who are interested in Asian culture, media, finding a like-minded community to share their creative side. However, since certain clubs have certain commitments, users may wonder if they are a good fit for the club. As such, visiting the website would give the user a clearer idea of what the club is and allow the users to directly contact board members if they have additional personalized questions to further allow them to decide if the club is the right one for them.

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

This content is right for our audience because it gives them a clear understanding of what CME is as an organization. Our content introduces the club, its goals, and its events, thus meeting the needs of the audience. This content address the goals of the audience by explain how they can get involved with CME or in the case of sponsors, why CME is an organization that is worth supporting. Specifically, event pictures and descriptions greatly contribute to a user’s understanding of CME, beyond any blurb explicitly explaining what the organization does.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![Card Sorting 1](cardsorting1.png)
The home page of the website contains all the information necessary for people to learn about the club, including a group photo, an introduction to the club, its goals, sponsorships, and other relevant details. These are crucial pieces of information that help people understand what the website is about and gain a better understanding of the club's purpose.

On the "Events" page, visitors can find detailed information about the events the club has held in the past, which may attract people who are interested in joining the club.

The "Team" page includes a group photo, team photos, positions, and information about the executive board. People can learn about the club's structure and key members on this page.

Finally, on the "Apply" page, visitors can find the recruitment plan, the kind of people the club is looking for, and contact information such as email and phone number. This helps people understand the recruitment process if they are interested in joining the club.

![Card Sorting 2](cardsorting2.png)
The main focus of the homepage is to help potential customers gain access to the club. Therefore, all other information has been removed, except for the contact information. As an event planning club, the homepage is designed to draw attention to event photos. Therefore, group photos have been removed.

However, the Team page contains more information about the club, including positions available for potential members to apply for. Quotes from current members about why they joined the club have been included on this page to give applicants a better understanding of what the club is about.

The Apply page has been kept simple, with only the necessary information included to avoid confusing potential candidates.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Iteration 1

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

Our primary target audience comprises individuals who are interested in becoming a part of the club or potential sponsors. As a result, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of sponsorship on the Homepage. Moreover, group photos should also be displayed on the Homepage to showcase the unity and wholesomeness of the targeted audience, treating members like a family. Displaying team photos along with the positions held helps to humanize the club by showcasing its members and leadership. It can help build a sense of familiarity and approachability. Providing a clear outline of the recruitment plan and the type of members the club is seeking can streamline the application process for interested individuals, making it user-friendly and accessible.
The iteration also respects the user’s need for information hierarchy and accessibility, making it easier for them to navigate the website and engage with the club, whether they are people who want to apply for the club or potential sponsors. This design demonstrates an understanding of the audience's informational needs and their journey through the club's digital presence.


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Event
- Team
- Apply

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

The "Home" page is the first point of contact for potential sponsors and applicants. It should showcase the club's essence and vibrancy, highlighting its key achievements, ongoing initiatives, and a summary of its mission and vision. This is essential for creating a strong first impression.

For sponsors, the "Home" page provides a quick snapshot of the club's activities and its impact, which helps them assess the club's alignment with their corporate social responsibility (CSR) and investment strategies.

For applicants, the "Home" page offers a concise overview of what the club stands for, its culture, and the benefits of joining.

On the other hand, the "Event" page provides details of the club's past and future activities. This is essential for sponsors to evaluate the level of engagement and potential visibility they could gain from sponsoring the club. It also highlights the club's dynamism and inclusivity, which is a point of interest for sponsors looking to invest in organizations that are actively developing their membership base.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Theme Ideas:

   1. Formal & Professional

   2. Fun & Playful

For the CME website, we've chosen a dual-themed approach, combining a formal and professional tone with a touch of fun and playfulness. The color palette revolves around CME's brand colors of grey and red, projecting a sense of stability and vibrancy. The use of structured layouts, serif fonts, and high-quality imagery contributes to the professional theme, appealing to audiences seeking credibility. Simultaneously, playful color accents, friendly typography, whimsical graphics, and interactive elements inject a dynamic and engaging aspect into the site. This combination is carefully tailored to resonate with a diverse audience—professionals who value a serious tone and a broader audience looking for a lively and interactive online experience. The result is a website that meets the goals of providing reliable information while keeping the user experience both professional and accessible.



## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

Idea: Implement a collapsible hamburger menu for navigation. This menu can neatly organize various sections, ensuring that users can easily access different parts of the site without overwhelming the initial interface on narrow screen.
Rationale: The hamburger menu enhances functionality by decluttering the interface, providing a clean and organized layout, aligning with their goal of efficiently accessing information on the CME website.

- Event details Accordion
Idea: Utilize an accordion-style display for event details on narrow screen, where users can click on an event to expand and view additional information such as date, time, and location.
Rationale: This interactive element enhances user experience by presenting detailed event information in a compact and easily digestible format. Users can quickly scan through events, allowing them to focus on what is most relevant to their goals.

- Carousel for images/Quotes
Idea: Integrate a carousel feature to showcase images or quotes, perhaps highlighting team members or event snapshots. Users can navigate through a series of images and quotes with arrows or swipe gestures.
Rationale: The carousel adds a visually engaging element, offering a dynamic way to present information. For the audience seeking a mix of formality and playfulness, this interactive feature provides an aesthetically pleasing and efficient means to showcase important visuals without overwhelming the page.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![ Iteration 1: Narrow](narrow-pic.jpg)
![ Iteration 1: Wide](wide-pic.jpg)
On the homepage, the carousel of club members participating in different activities gives the viewer an idea of what the club is like and gives the viewer a feeling of invitation. It is followed by a welcome message and a brief description of what the club is to further create an inviting feeling. Afterwards, there is a section that shares current members experiences to further provide insight for potential members of the club. Last the not least, it is ended with list of sponsors to perhaps encourage more sponsors to join.


![ Iteration 2: Narrow](narrow-test.jpg)
![ Iteration 2: WIde](wide-test.jpg)

On the homepage, it contains a paragraph explaining what the club is to introduce the participants to what the club is. After that is a section that describes the main attributes of the club so the audience can further gage if the club is for them. Then it is a carousel that shares current member's experience, and what currents members gain from being in CME. The current member's experience is made into a carousel to save space, as texts of quotes are redundant. Afterwards is a list of sponsors to perhaps encourage more sponsors to join

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Please provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow Design:**

![Narrow Team page](team_narrow.png)
The top banner includes the logo on top left, the club name in the middle, and the navigation bar as a drop-down menu on top right. On the team page, there is a group photo under banner and below it are individual introduction and profile photos. The E-board members' introductions are arranged in a column flexbox when the screen is narrow. Additionally, quotes from other members are displayed in a carousel format. The audience can view different quotes by clicking the arrow.

![Narrow Events Page](events-narrow.JPG)
The events page includes an introduction of the mission of CME events under the central heading. Then there is a list of events including the rapping competition, the funraising station, and the Halloween party. In every section, the time and an image of the event is provided and vertically stacked. Users can also click the "+ Event Details" button to expand and see more details of the event.

[!Narrow Applications Page](applications-narrow.JPG)
The applications page provides users with a blurb on what sorts of members CME is looking to add to their team. Additionally, it features two pictures of the current team, giving users an idea of who they would be working with if they joined CME. On the narrow page, the images are listeed underneath the "Who are we looking for?" section.


**Wide Design:**

![Wide Team page](team_wide.png)
On the team page, the hamburger drop-down menu transforms into a navigation bar that appears under the logo. The introduction of E-board members has been modified to be arranged horizontally, with three people in a row when the page is wide. Furthermore, quotes from other members are still presented in a carousel format, but now, their lines expand in length.

![Wide Events Page](events-wide.JPG)
The events page includes an introduction of the mission of CME events under the central heading. Then there is a list of events including the rapping competition, the funraising station, and the Halloween party. In every section, the time, the description and an image of the event is provided.

[!Wide Applications Page](applications-wide.jpg)
The applications page provides users with a blurb on what sorts of members CME is looking to add to their team. Situated next to the blurb are two images of current club members at a club retreat. With these images in combination with the explanatory blurb, potential applications can kearn who is currently in the club as well as the fun activities that club members engage with one another in.


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

Our design is appropriate for our adience of potential sponsors and COrnell students interested in CME because it informs them on what CME is, who is apart of it, and how they can get involved. Our navigation - which features the pages home, events, apply, and team - makes all of this necessary information easy to find and access. Moreover, our navbar uses the design pattern of the navigation being on the top of the screen and shrinking to a hamburger menu for narrow screens. A student looking to join the club would want to know how to join, what they would be doing as a club member, and who they would be working with. Potential sponsors would be interested in CME’s goals, missions, past events, and impact on students; the organization of the content on our pagss immediately supplies users with this knowledge.


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

Hamburger menu: Since users, especially college students, often browse the internet on narrow screens like iPhones, a hamburger menu helps make navigation accessible for all users, regardless of what size screen they are using. In this way, the hamburger menu addresses the goals of our site’s audience by making seamless content navigation unconditional.


Team member modal: a modal with member information and contact would appear after clicking on the image, allowing users to learn more about the member and be able to get in contact with them in a digestible format.


Images/quotes carousels: The use of carousels removes the limit of quotes and images that the page can hold by storing them all in the same place. Through this, we can supply users with the experiences of many CME members as well as an increased number of images.



## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

The carousel looks the same on wide and narrow screen, adjusting to fit screen size
![Carousel ](carousel.jpg)

The modal looks the same on wide and narrow screen, adjusting to fit screen size
![Modal](modal.jpg)

When #hamburger is pushed,
If #hamburger-menu is hidden:
Remove .hidden from #hamburger-menu:
Else:
Add .hidden to #hamburger-menu


(#hamburger-menu is a button with the initial state hidden)

When the img #alice is clicked:
Remove .hidden from #aliceclick
When the .exit (the exit button) is clicked:
Add .hidden from #aliceclick



## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

15 mins

Client: April Liu
Feedback: The website is so far pretty good, includes most of the contents we need. For next milestone, try to put more pictures on the event section to attract more people to come. The event pictures can also become a carousel for people to view. There can be a Q&A on the Application page.

## Website Revision Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

- Deleted the accordion as the users mentioned it's an extra, unnecessary step to see the event information.
- Added a pop-up modal to provide more details about the board. Since users were clicking onto the board members to find contact information, we decided to add a modal that allows for that to make the website easier for the user to use.
- Seperated the "Who are we looking for" and the "Recruitment Timeline" and changed the style of those two parts in order to make visualization easier. Sometimes can't easily find it within seconds so they go on different pages.
