# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

     We strive to design a good website for our client

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    1. Respecting everyone’s opinions, regardless of whether or not you agree.
    2. Regularly communicating updates in our group chat.
    3. Attending group meetings or notifying the group of an excepted absence.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    1. We will meet at least once a week and communicate frequently in a groupchat.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    1. Schedule meetings ahead of time and provide client with an agenda of questions to expect.
    2. Schedule regular check-ins or video conferences to discuss project updates, address any concerns, and maintain a personal connection.
    3. Establish a system for the client to provide feedback, mainly through scheduled feedback sessions.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Alice: Primary interviewer and collecting answers
	Chris: Proofreader - looking over written responses for typos and errors, rectifying any that are found
	Yanran: Uniforming website visuals to be aligned among pages
    Sandy: Trouble shooting and solving problems that the group might run into code wise.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We will hold ourselves accountable through regular meetings and communications between members. If someone is not doing their share of work, we will point that out and ask them the reasons why they are not completing their share of work.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    When we run into a disagreement, our first reaction will be to consult the group contract and act according to what it says, rather than acting irresponsibly. When conflict arises, we agree to remain levelheaded and respectful to one another.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    If we run into any problems, we will discuss among group members and update any changes we decide afterwards.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    Get boba after every meeting.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
